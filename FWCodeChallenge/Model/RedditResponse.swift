// I often group related objects, extensions, and protcols together in a file. I do this to keep the file structure from getting cluttered and when one grows more important or larger than the rest I separate it into another file.
// The JSON structure from the reddit API demanded many different objects be used for the sake of Codable. I pressed on using it because I really wanted to be make use of Swift 4's capabilities but in the future I would not use Codable for an API like this one.
